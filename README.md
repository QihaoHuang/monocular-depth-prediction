# Monocular-Depth-Prediction
- Targeted on Monocular Depth Estimation based on NYU DepthV2 Dataset.
- Reimplemented the original Eigen paper (Torch/MATLAB) with PyTorch, also improved the performance by fusion of ResNet and FCN into Multi-Scale CNN training.

course project of `Computational Photography` Year 2018. June
- depth: We reproduce Eigen's Multi-Scale Paper (2014/5 NIPS) based on PyTorch(0.4). 
- depth_fully_conv: Laina2016 FCNR
